"""
jobivo_aggregator.py - Simple FastAPI service to serve job listings for Jobivo

This aggregator provides a set of endpoints to retrieve job offers, save an offer and
hide an offer. It's intended to be run on Render with a command like:

    uvicorn jobivo_aggregator:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Environment variables:
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS: a comma-separated list of domains allowed by CORS.

The service stores saved/hidden job IDs in memory for demonstration purposes. It
returns up to 10 active offers at `/offers` and prevents showing saved or
hidden offers for 90 days.
